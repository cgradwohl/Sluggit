Max:
I tested the components I created with Postman and MongoDB Compass as I was developing my 
components. I also used extensive logging to the console to ensure that the values were being
properly processed. MongoDB Compass allowed me to ensure that the final state of the object
that is modified or created is saved properly. Postman allowed me to create a test stub that
would test all the possible inputs. The combination of all four allowed me to test all aspects
of my components that I created.


Tarum: 
I worked on making sure a user was able to edit their profile correctly, as well as front end development on profile layout. 
After that, I tested the functionality of this, as well as editing and deleting user posts. 

Hope:
After creating the post to database feature, I worked with Max to test that the functionality was working. 
Worked with Tarum to create the system tests report. Specifically, worked on testing the login and post tests. 

Diego:
I worked on cleaning up the layout for the home page as well as desgining the visual layout of the public feed 
as well as the popluar feed. Most of it was done with boot strap themes

Jasmine:
I worked on making sure the post like functionality worked as intended. I also tested to make sure the public feed properly sorted posts by the number of likes.
